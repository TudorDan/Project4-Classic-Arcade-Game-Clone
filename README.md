## About The Game

The purpose of this game is to meet the fourth project requirements from the _Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program_. As requested, this is a readme file regarding the relevant details about the game and its dependencies.

## Game Instructions

First, make sure you click this link [Play Game](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/TudorDan/Project4-Classic-Arcade-Game-Clone/blob/master/index.html) in order to start the application.

Then click the arrow keys so that the player can reach the water. Three lives are alloted to the user and each time the player collides with a bug, one life is lost. Each time the player reaches the water, the game becomes harder (the number of bugs increases indefinitely).

The game's objective is to achieve the highest level before losing all lives.

Once all three lives of the player are lost, the game restarts from difficulty level 1 (with one bug).

===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
